    <div class="grid-item"><p>A little about what inspired us... This is <strong> Charlotte Cooper.</strong> She is known as the trailblazer for woman in sport and rightly so. 
        She was the first woman to champion in the olympics, gaining a gold medal for team GB. Doing so in 1900. She also holds 5 Wimbledon titles to her name
        and worked hard to encourage other woman to pursue careers in sport. Although we have come far since the days of Charlotte Cooper there is still such a gap between the 
        world of men's sport and women's sport</p>
    <p>Our aim is to provide inspiration for girls to pursue their dreams just like Charlotte Cooper did in her day. 
        We wamt continue her great work and
